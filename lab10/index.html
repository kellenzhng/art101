					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to create an input field and a button to better implement the previous Lab 7 function. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The main issue we had was that we were getting a NULL error.
						<br>
						We found out that it was due to the JavaScript code being unable to locate the assoiated ID within the HTML div.
						<br>
						After we fixed the identifiers, the code ran smoothly.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this lab went well! Seeing the button work with the input field felt more visually rewarding compared to past labs.
						<br>
						Although we had some bumps in our coding process, going back and forth in the console to figure it out was a nice experience.
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					Input your name: <input type= "input" id="user-name">
					<button id = "my-button">Rearrange! </button>
