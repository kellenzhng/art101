			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged us to use condiitonals in order to show a specific output.
						<br>
						This output corresponds to the input the user puts into the submission box, sorting them into different houses.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really have much issues with this lab as it was pretty easy to grasp.
						<br>
						I think most of the difficulty was challenging myself into putting the code as jQuery a opposed to regular JavaScript.
					 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I had a pretty good time this lab! I understood the content and I think the context of Harry Potter made it fun.
						<br>
						Bonus points since I am currently watching Harry Potter with my friends since I've never seen it prior.
					 </p>
