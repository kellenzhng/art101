			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab highlights how arrays and objects work in JavaScript.
						<br>
						We learn how to create arrays and objects, while also understanding
						how to reference their elements.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One minor issue I had was when declaring the elements within the object,
						I had used semi colons instead of commas to end each element.
						<br>
						This resulted in an error, but I quickly recognized and fixed the issue.
					 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I thought this lab went pretty well. I was able to understand how arrays
						and objects work, while also working with accessing their elements.
						<br>
						One thing I had hoped for however, was working more with nested arrays and objects
						in this lab to get a deeper understanding of accessing arrays and objects.
						<br>
						Because of this, I spent a bit more time experimenting with accessing nested arrays
						and arrays in objects to really understand the challenge of this lab.
					 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p1> To the left is the result of the lab.
						<br>
						The resulting script output displays the output from the array showing my modes of transportation
						<br>
						as well as the object detailing my main mode of transportation.
