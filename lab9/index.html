			<h1>Lab 9 - Javascript for the Web</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab aimed at experimenting with DOM manipulation in Javascript.
						<br>
						We are challenged to change the CSS of the page elements while also exploring other methods and attributes.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Throughout this lab, my partner and I had some syntax errors that caused some confusion.
						<br>
						Other than that, the main problem I had was figuring out how to link an image 
						<br>
						through manipulating DOM elements, which was solved by simply linking the image path in the ID.
					 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I think this lab went well! There were a few hiccups, but my partner and I
						<br>
						 were able to resolve the issues together by looking through the console around
						 <br>
						 identifying the problem within the code. We both put in a team effort in figuring out the lab 
						 <br>
						 and helping each other out.
