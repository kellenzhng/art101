			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab aimed at creating an organized local file structure on my computer.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Much of the work in creating a structure was already done, so I didn't have many difficulties.
						 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It was pretty easy to follow along the lab.
						I think that having good organization was always one of my strong points, so this was relatively straightforward. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
