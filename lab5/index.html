			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to introduce Javascript data types and work with variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem I had was with my Javascript file changes not showing up on the page. 
						<br>
						After messing around for a while, my partner pointed out that my document.writeln function was wrong!
						<br>
						I had mistaken the "L" for an "I". After changing it, the changes were finally seen.
					 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Our efforts in this lab went pretty well. 
						We programmed side by side and were able to understand the lab pretty much with no significant issues.
						<br>
						I pretty much followed the lab steps and made sure things went smoothly while also updating the CSS 
						file to more cleanly portray the lab.
					 </p>
