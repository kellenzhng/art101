			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge in this lab was to implement a function that takes user input and alter it.
                        <br>
                        Additionally, I think another added challenge in the extra challenge was working with nested functions and methods.
                     </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This time around, I had a few problems throughout the lab.
                        <br>
                    I had some programming semantic errors that I didn't catch until someone else took a look at my code. 
                    <br>
                    I think I was too tired to catch them, but I made quite a few that cost me a bit of time to figure out like
                    forgetting the period in document.writeln and a semcolon in one of the lines.
                    <br>
                    Also, I had an issue in that the pop up window occurred twice, but I realized that it was because 
                    I had the code to link the JavaScript file twice.

                </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Honestly, I think this lab was pretty tiring. 
                        <br>
                        I think it was the semantic errors that I made combined with the lack of energy I had this week that made it seem 
                        more frustrating than it should've been.
                        <br> 
                        Despite this, I ended up attempting one of the extra tasks and looking more into the sort function.
                    </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
                        <p> Below is the resulting output for the function: 
                            <br>
                        </p>

                        <h2>Script Output</h2>
                        <script src="js/lab.js"></script>
                        </div>
