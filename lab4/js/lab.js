/*Pseudocode:
1. Accept user input to start the round.
    If playing with another person, get their input as well.

2. Validate user input(s).
    User input must be one of the following: Rock, Paper, Scissors
    If input does not match, keep asking for input until it is one of the three options.
    If one of the two players is a computer, generate a random valid input for the computer player.

3. Compare both inputs with each other to determine the winner.
    If both players played the same input, the result is a tie and both players put in another input. (round resets)
    If a player’s input is Rock, they win if the opposing input is Scissors.
    If a player’s input is Paper, they win if the opposing input is Rock.
    If a player’s input is Scissors, they win if the opposing input is Paper.

4. Update the game score.
    The winner of a round receives one point

5. Repeat the above steps until a player has received two points. (Best out of three)
    First player to get two points wins the game.
