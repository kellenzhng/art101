			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged our ability to create outlines to solve problems.
						By writing pseudocode, we were tasked with detailing a step by step plan to tackle a problem.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really encounter any issues since this was mainly just pseudocode in planning the actual code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I think this assignment went pretty well and as someone with beginner level programming experience, I was
						reminded of pseudocode's importance. I had learned how to program starting with pseudocode and this was a 
					nice refresher / callback to when I first started learning how to code. </p>
